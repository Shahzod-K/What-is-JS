# What is JS ?
## JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
### *The role of JS in web developing is to make web-site alive*
## The history of JS :
>Creator of JS is "Brendan Eich", he invented JS just in 10 days, its first name was Mocha, but it already had many fundamental features of modern JS

>It was changed to LiveScript and then to JavaScript to attract Java developers, and JavaScript has almost nothing to do with Java.

>Microsoft launches IE, "copying JavaScript from Netscape" and called it JScript

>To standardise language , ECMA releases ECMAScript 1 (ES1), the first "official standard for JavaScript" (ECMAScript is the standard, JS the language in practice)

>ES5 was released with a lot of new and great features, <br>
ES6/ES2015 was released : "the biggest update to language ever!"

>Starting with ES6 till now is Modern JS, JS updates every year

## How to run JS code:
1. Using console tab of web browsers
2. Using Node.js
3. By creating web pages
## 1. Using Console Tab of Web Browsers
1. Open your browser and right click in any empty area and select inspect or press F12.
2. Open the developer tools and go to Console tab. Write the Javascript code and press Enter
## 2. Using Node.js
Node is a back-end environment for executing JavaScript 
code. To run JS using Node.js, follow these steps:
1. Install the latest version of Node.js.
2. Open Visual studio code and create js file
3. Run node hello.js
4. See the result
## 3. By creating web pages
JavaScript was initially created to make web pages 
interactive, that's why JavaScript and HTML go hand in 
hand. To run JS from a webpage, follow these steps:
1. Create new folder 
2. Create index.html, script.js files
3. Connect html to js:
```html
<script src="main.js"></script>
```
# JS variables and constants 
### 1. var-is used in older versions of JS
### 2. let-is the new way of declaring variables from(ES6,ES2015)
### 3. const-is defined as 'block scoped'
>In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.<br>
In Javascript there is two types of intializing variables, var and let. You can use both of them. However, there are some differences between them. <br>
If you are sure that the value of a variable won't change throughout the program, it's recommended to use const .
## Value : 
### 1. OBJECT
### 2. PRIMITIVE
PRIMITIVES : 
1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean 
4. Undefined
5. Null
6. Symbol
7. Bigint

OBJECTS : 
1. Object literal
2. Arrays
3. Functions
4. Many more...

>*JS has dynamic typing* : We do *not* have to manually define the data type of the stored in a variable (Value has type, NOT variable). Instead, data types are determined *automatically*

## Rules for naming JS variables :
1. Variable names must start with either a letter, an underscore _, or the dollar sign $.
2. Variable names cannot start with numbers.
# Operators in JS
1. Arithmetic=> + - * /
2. Comperison=> == === >= <= != !==
3. Logical=> || && !
4. Type Conversions=> Number("3.14")
5. Assignment=> = += -= *= /= ^= %=
## *Type Conversion has 2 types:*
### *1. Implicit TC*
### *2. Explicit TC*
# 3 types of Condition:
## 1. IF/Else
## 2. Ternary Operator
## 3. Switch
# 3 types of Loop:
## 1. For
## 2. While
## 3. Do/While
# Functions. 3 types:
## 1. Declaration
## 2. Expression=>1. Arrow F, 2.Anonymous F
## 3. IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
